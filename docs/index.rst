The EU-funded DComEX project plans to develop numerical methods enhanced by artificial intelligence as well as a scalable software framework that enables exascale computing. A key innovation of DComEX is the development of AI-Solve, a novel scalable library of AI-enhanced algorithms for solving large-scale sparse linear systems, which are fundamental to computational mechanics. Researchers will fuse physics-constrained machine learning with efficient block-iterative methods and incorporate experimental data at multiple levels of fidelity to quantify model uncertainties. Efficient deployment of these methods in exascale supercomputers will offer scientists and engineers unprecedented capabilities for conducting predictive simulations of mechanical systems in applications ranging from bioengineering to manufacturing.
